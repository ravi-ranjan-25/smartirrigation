**Smart Farming**

The proposed system comes with an abundance of ways in which IoT devices and AI could potentially be applied to benefit
the irrigation system. The system fully runs on solar power which enables us to save nearly 5 million kilo watt hours of
energy yearly. Also by automating the irrigation system the exact amount of water required is supplied to the field. The
system divides the entire field into 4 grids and again subdivides them into several sub-grids which comes with high range
capacitive sensors, which measures the accurate soil moisture and sends it to the cloud for Data Analytics. This makes the
system easily scalable for production. The system also provides all the real-time necessary information (UV index,
Humidity, Weather description, etc.) based on the location and other parameters of the land. At the same time the crops health
is being monitored by using image processing. The Exact Amount of Water required for each grid is predicted by using
modern AI-ML Tools, and supplied to the specific grids with the help of automated valves and sprinklers. The Pumps used,
also consume power from the solar-panel which comes from a battery and a converter. The system also predicts the Total
Power Consumption, Solar Power Generation and the Soil Yield (to maintain the crop cycle) using modern AI-ML
Algorithms. It also comes with a cross-platform application (Web/Mobile) which presents every data in a graph format for
easy understanding. We are also creating an online market place which allows the farmers to sell their products directly and
at the same time the govt. agencies can keep a track of the exact production quantity. This single platform comes with a lot of
features including the Paytm payment gateway integration to support digital India. In this way the proposed AI-ML based
system aims to deliver a smart, automated, and user-friendly irrigation solution.
